/**
 * Simple utility that reruns task in another thread and reports the result back.
 * <p/>
 * The goal is to run validation in a non-UI thread. Some validation results
 * may be dropped as user input may change before validation completes.
 * <p/>
 * Some threading information:
 * invalidate()           is called by client from any thread to signal that
 *                        user input had changed and needs to be invalidated.
 *                        This will mark this validator as dirty and schedule
 *                        a runnable in the background thread if there is none
 *                        pending/running.
 *
 * validate()             will be called on a background thread to obtain
 *                        the validation result. This call can be repeated
 *                        if the data is marked dirty before a call to
 *                        validate() completes.
 *
 * showValidationResult() will be called on the UI thread with the data
 *                        returned by validate() called on a background thread.
 *                        Note that that data may be dropped if invalidate()
 *                        was called at some point while the UI thread task
 *                        was pending.
