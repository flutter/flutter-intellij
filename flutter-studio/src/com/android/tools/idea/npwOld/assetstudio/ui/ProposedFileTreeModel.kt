/**
 * A [TreeModel] representing the sub-tree of the file system relevant to a pre-determined set of
 * proposed new [File]s relative to a given root directory. The model keeps track of which of the
 * non-directory [File]s already existed **when the model was created**. If a path to a proposed
 * file contains non-existing intermediate directories, these will also be considered new files.
 *
 * The model marks each relevant file and directory with an [Icon] for rendering (see
 * [ProposedFileTreeCellRenderer]). By default, proposed files are marked with either [DIR_ICON]
 * for directories or [DEFAULT_ICON] for regular files. However, callers can specify the [Icon]
 * corresponding to each proposed [File] by passing a [Map] to the appropriate constructor.
 *
 * Directory contents preserve the iteration order of the [Set] or [Map] used to construct the model.
 * For example, if the model is built from the sorted map
 *
 * { File("root/sub1/file1"): icon1, File("root/sub2/file2"): icon2 }
 *
 * then *sub1* will appear before *sub2* in the model of *root*'s children, since it appeared first
 * when iterating over the map entries.
