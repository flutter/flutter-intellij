/**
 * The step for configuring project parameters creates various UI components in order to collect
 * inputs from the user. This package houses the classes which generate those UI components.
 *
 * Admidst all the noise, there are two classes to pay close attention to -
 *
 * {@link com.android.tools.idea.npwOld.template.components.ComponentProvider} which is a top-level
 * interface that makes it easy to link Swing components and Swing properties.
 *
 * {@link com.android.tools.idea.npwOld.template.components.ParameterComponentProvider} which is a
 * ComponentProvider with extra logic for handling defaults provided by the
 * {@link com.android.tools.idea.templates.Parameter} class.
