Classes in this directory (`src` and `testSrc`) are modifications and extensions
of classes originally defined in the Dart plugin. They should be merged into the
Dart plugin before the Flutter plugin switches to `stable`.

The original files can be found in the Dart plugin at:
https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-plugins/blob/master/Dart.
