[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flutter/flutter-intellij.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/flutter/flutter-intellij)

An IntelliJ plugin for [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) development. Flutter is a new mobile
app SDK to help developers and designers build modern mobile apps for iOS and Android.

## Documentation

- [Getting Started with IntelliJ](https://flutter.io/intellij-ide/)

## Fast development

Flutter's <em>hot reload</em> helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features,
and fix bugs faster. Experience sub-second reload times, without losing state, on emulators,
simulators, and hardware for iOS and Android.

## Quick-start

A brief summary of the [getting started guide](https://flutter.io/intellij-ide/):

- install the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.io/setup/)
- run `flutter doctor` from the command line to verify your installation
- ensure you have a supported [IntelliJ development environment](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download), either:
  - IntelliJ 2017.3 or 2018.1, Community or Ultimate Edition, or
  - Android Studio 3.1 (note: Android Studio 3.2 Canary is currently _not_ supported)
- open the plugin preferences
  - `Preferences > Plugins` on macOS, `File > Settings > Plugins` on Linux, select "Browse repositoriesâ€¦"
- search for and install the 'Flutter' plugin
- choose the option to restart IntelliJ
- configure the Flutter SDK setting
  - `Preferences` on macOS, `File>Settings` on Linux, select `Languages & Frameworks > Flutter`, and set
    the path to the root of your flutter repo

## Preview Dart 2

The latest version of the IntelliJ and Android Studio plugin allows you to configure whether your
app is analyzed and run with the preview version of Dart 2.0. This will control things like
the way your code is statically analyzed, and the behavior of the runtime type system (and the type
errors you'll see).

By default, we pick up the base setting from the Flutter SDK. This can be overridden in the
Preferences dialog, in `Languages & Settings` > `Flutter`. You can change the 'Run applications in
Dart 2.0 mode' preference from:
- using the Flutter SDK default
- enabling preview Dart 2.0, or
- disabling preview Dart 2.0

  [YouTrack tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues?q=%23Dart%20%23Unresolved%20)

## Known issues

Please note the following known issues:

- [#601](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/601): IntelliJ will
  read the PATH variable just once on startup. Thus, if you change PATH later to
  include the Flutter SDK path, this will not have an affect in IntelliJ until you
  restart the IDE.
- If you are building Flutter plugins using Swift, be sure you have at least`cocoapods 1.5.0` 
  installed; an issue tracking a corresponding update to `flutter doctor` is:
  [flutter/#16930](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/16930).
