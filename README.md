## Flutter Plugin for IntelliJ

An IntelliJ plugin for [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) development. For documentation, see [flutter.io](https://flutter.io/intellij-ide/).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flutter/flutter-intellij.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/flutter/flutter-intellij)

## Getting started

See [flutter.io/setup](https://flutter.io/setup/) for instructions about installing the Flutter SDK, configuring your machine for Flutter development, and installing and configuring the IntelliJ plugins.

See [flutter.io/intellij-ide](https://flutter.io/intellij-ide/) for more detailed instructions about developing Flutter apps using IntelliJ.

## Quick-start

A very brief summary of the getting started guide linked from above:

- install the Flutter SDK (see [flutter.io/setup](https://flutter.io/setup/)); run `flutter doctor` from the command line to verify your installation
- ensure you have a supported IntelliJ development environment (IntelliJ 2017.1+, Ultimate or Community)
- open the plugin preferences (Preferences>Plugins on macOS, File>Settings>Plugins on Linux, select "Browse repositoriesâ€¦")
- search for and install the 'Flutter' plugin
- choose the option to restart IntelliJ
- configure the Flutter SDK setting (Preferences on macOS, File>Settings on Linux, select Languages & Frameworks>Flutter, and set the path to the root of your flutter repo)

## Known issues

Please note the following known issues:

* the device chooser can open Android emulators (and the iOS simulator on MacOS). However, in order to locate the Android SDK,
  the Flutter plugin relies on the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable being set; follow https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/1150 for an improved solution.
* We are seeing occasional timeouts when trying to connect to Observatory when debugging against the iOS simulator; restarting the simulator should get you back on track.
* [#601](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/601): IntelliJ will read the PATH
  variable just once on startup. Thus, if you change PATH later to include the Flutter SDK path,
  this will not have an affect in IntelliJ until you restart the IDE.
