[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flutter/flutter-intellij.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/flutter/flutter-intellij)

An IntelliJ plugin for [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) development. Flutter is a multi-platform
app SDK to help developers and designers build modern apps for iOS, Android and the web.

## Documentation

- [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev)
- [Installing Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Getting Started with IntelliJ](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/ide)

## Fast development

Flutter's <em>hot reload</em> helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features,
and fix bugs faster. Experience sub-second reload times, without losing state, on emulators,
simulators, and hardware for iOS and Android.

## Quick-start

A brief summary of the [getting started guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/ide):

- install the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- run `flutter doctor` from the command line to verify your installation
- ensure you have a supported IntelliJ development environment; either:
  - the latest stable version of [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download), Community or Ultimate Edition (EAP versions are not always supported)
  - the latest stable version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (note: Android Studio Canary versions are generally _not_ supported)
- open the plugin preferences
  - `Preferences > Plugins` on macOS, `File > Settings > Plugins` on Linux, select "Browse repositoriesâ€¦"
- search for and install the 'Flutter' plugin
- choose the option to restart IntelliJ
- configure the Flutter SDK setting
  - `Preferences` on macOS, `File>Settings` on Linux, select `Languages & Frameworks > Flutter`, and set
    the path to the root of your flutter repo

## Known issues

Please note the following known issues:

- [#601](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/601): IntelliJ will
  read the PATH variable just once on startup. Thus, if you change PATH later to
  include the Flutter SDK path, this will not have an affect in IntelliJ until you
  restart the IDE.
- If you require network access to go through proxy settings, you will need to set the 
  `https_proxy` variable in your environment as as described in the 
  [pub docs](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/troubleshoot#pub-get-fails-from-behind-a-corporate-firewall).
